5. **Wireframes:** *The proposed layout and design of your app. Create mockups for your views. If your are creating multiple views including both desktop and mobile formats, and consider whether or not you need to account for landscape and portrait orientations. Please use a digital tool to complete your wireframe.*<p>This is a very basic mockup. I plan on having a much prettier page. </p> ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/84357702/121180677-1bc75b00-c82f-11eb-93cc-25df836425ea.png)![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/84357702/121180789-3a2d5680-c82f-11eb-901c-35e365e876d8.png)
6. **MVP:** *A list of features you will need to build in order to meet the Minimum Viable Product. This will be the rubric your project will be graded against.* These are the requirements of the features I will need to build. 
   1. Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
   2. Use Axios to make a request to an external data source and insert some of the retrieved data on to the DOM.
   3. Implement responsive design using at least one media query/breakpoint (i.e. desktop, tablet, mobile, etc).
   4. Fulfill the build requirements you have specified in your MVP.
   5. Deployed site on Surge.
   6. Make commits to GitHub every day.
   7. A README.md file that contains your project worksheet, a link to your live, deployed site, and any necessary installation instructions such as npm i/
7. **Post-MVP:** *A list of additional/advanced features you would like to include in your app after you have met MVP.*
   1. add an additional API-a horoscope API.
   2. add some type of animation - a wheel of some sort?
8. **Goals:** *What you plan to accomplish for each day of the project week.*

    | Sunday | M | 0hrs|  | |   |  |   |
    | Total |  | 36hrs|    |  |   |  |   |

   1. Day 1- Clone repo, build HTL, CSS and JS framework. Set up developer notes for step by step instructions. Create Vanilla navigation with Text and input           box. Finalize design elements (text, background elements for page and boxes, pictures, etc.)
   2. Day 2- Create all functions and code needed to make axios request work. Goal by the end of day 2 is to have input from my API showing up on the screen!
   3. Day 3- CSS heavy day (AKA DESIGN DAY!). Use Flexbox/Grid to properly align all items on page. Style the navigation. Style box. Style text on page. Create    back ground elements. Implement responsive design.  
   4. Day 4- Any final touches on CSS. Double check any code. Test for any bugs. Goal by the end of the day is to have project ready to be turned in, minus any bonus or additional details. If everything is DONE then intiate BONUS of adding a second API. Start by developing HTML and CSS for the second API. Create JS code blocks and make sure both are running smoothly with each other. LAST DAY FOR CODE!
   5. Day 5 - IF ALL CAUGHT UP and DONE with initial project and working on BONUS: Design day for second API, final touches. Deploy site to Surge and update the read.me file. NO CODE! 
9. **Priority Matrix:** *A graph of your intended areas of development (Pseudocoding, Design, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Testing, etc) plotted on an X/Y axis where X represents time to completion and Y represents priority. Use a professional tool or upload a well drawn image using an image hosting site such as Cloudinary or a similar hosting service.* ![1AF9333B-3526-4523-B2DB-5E069ED25B45_1_105_c](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/84357702/121060203-562deb00-c790-11eb-85f7-541bcde23b03.jpeg)
10. **Timeframes:** *How long you anticipate spending on each area of development. Be sure to consider how many hours a day you plan to be coding and how many days you have available until presentation day. Components should be broken down into a maximum of 3 hours time blocks.*
