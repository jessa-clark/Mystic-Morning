LinkedIn Featured Link Preview Images Not Showing Up?? Try this.

Are you a React developer with a few projects that you want to show off on LinkedIn? Have you tried to simply type in your link and are met with this empty grey box?
Screenshot of a LinkedIn link preview not displaying the image we’re looking for.
This is what happened to me, and I didn’t completely understand what to do after reading through LinkedIn’s recommendations.
My projects were all based in React, so I’m going to show how I went about solving the problem through that library.
After I deployed my project, a public file was built containing the index.html, manifest.json, 🤖s.txt, etc.

*more on svg favicons here if interested.
We’re going to focus on the index.html file.

Add this prefix attribute in your html:
<html lang=”en” prefix=”og: http://ogp.me/ns#">
Here’s a great explanation of the prefix tag and why it is relevant.
Also, add these 5 meta tags:
<meta 
  property=”og:title”
  content=”Example Title” 
/>
<meta 
  name=”image” 
  property=”og:image” 
  content=”%PUBLIC_URL%/publicimage.png
/>
<meta 
  name=”author” 
  content=”Example Author” 
/>
<meta 
  property=”og:description” 
  content=”Example Description“
/>
<meta 
  property=”og:url” 
  content=”https://example.com" 
/>
